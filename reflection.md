- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
9/21 Wednesday evening TA session
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
Confusing: It was an unknown territory for me and compared to Python, its general organization and language set-up is totally different. Going through the code and doing example code in class was definitely helpful. Eventhough there's a lot of resources on the internet, you don't really know how/where to look for it. 
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
Generally, Java is technically more profount but also very hard to configure and code without a lot of planning. Because it's a compiled language, everything have to be according to the rule and precise. The difference between OOP is not really stark because we didn't start on complex codes, but so far, I like how organized it is.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Splitting sentence into list of strings took a lot of help from others. I didn't know how to approach the problem as I had no experience in Java, and felt lost at times. But having a code partner who fills up my shortcoming is really helpful. Especially considering it's a first-time for a lot of students, suffering together is a joyous adventure. Taking baby steps and dividing up the work, so it doesn't feel overwhelming is very important. Look at the picture - yes - but not always. Sometimes you just got to take a step back and figure out one piece at a time.
